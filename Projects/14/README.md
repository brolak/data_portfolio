## Data Summary:

Dataset from [_ChaLearn Looking at People_](http://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.es/dataset/26/description/).

The dataset is stored in the `/datasets/faces/` folder, there you can find
- The `final_files` folder with 7.6k photos
- The `labels.csv` file with labels, with two columns: `file_name` and `real_age`

## Goal:

The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. You are asked to conduct that evaluation, so as you set to work, keep the following in mind:

- The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol
- Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo

The task then is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age.

## Instructions:

1. Pass a quiz to verify your understanding of the project statement.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to get an overall impression of the dataset.
3. Train and evaluate the model.
4. Combine your code, output and findings (from the previous points) in the final Jupyter notebook.
5. Make conclusions of the model evaluation, add them to the notebook.

## Libraries used:

tensorflow, keras, pandas, matplotlib, numpy
