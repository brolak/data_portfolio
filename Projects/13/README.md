## Data Summary:

- `review` - the review text
- `pos` - the target, '0' for negative and '1' for positive
- `ds_part` - 'train'/'test' for the train/test part of dataset, correspondingly

## Goal:

The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. You'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. 

It will need to reach an F1 score of at least 0.85.

## Libraries used:

pytorch, lightGBM, spacy, sklearn, nltk, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
